# Documentation image files

## Source for image files

Most image files are named `<something>.svg` and their source file `<something>.dia`.

Special cases:

* `internals-mapper-pojo-reindexingresolver-example1-builder-<number>.svg`:
these files were generated from a single source file with multiple layers,
`internals-mapper-pojo-reindexingresolver-example1-builder.dia`.

## Software to open source files

* `*.dia` files should be opened with [DIA](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia).
