/**
 * The context used when defining a boolean junction, allowing in particular to add clauses.
 * <p>
 * Different types of clauses have different effects, see below.
 *
 * <h3 id="must">"must" clauses</h3>
 * <p>
 * "must" clauses are required to match: if they don't match, then the boolean predicate will not match.
 * <p>
 * Matching "must" clauses are taken into account in score computation.
 *
 * <h3 id="mustnot">"must not" clauses</h3>
 * <p>
 * "must not" clauses are required to not match: if they don't match, then the boolean predicate will not match.
 * <p>
 * "must not" clauses are ignored from score computation.
 * <p>
 * "must not" clauses are
 *
 * <h3 id="filter">"filter" clauses</h3>
 * <p>
 * "filter" clauses are required to match: if they don't match, then the boolean predicate will not match.
 * <p>
 * "filter" clauses are ignored from score computation,
 * and so are any clauses of boolean predicates contained in the filter clause (even "match" or "should" clauses).
 *
 * <h3 id="should">"should" clauses</h3>
 * <p>
 * "should" clauses may optionally match, and are required to match depending on the context.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *     When there isn't any "must" clause nor any "filter" clause in the boolean predicate,
 *     and there is no "minimumShouldMatch" constraint (see below),
 *     then at least one "should" clause is required to match.
 *     Simply put, in this case, the "should" clauses
 *     <strong>behave as if there was an "OR" operator between each of them</strong>.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     When there is at least one "must" clause or one "filter" clause in the boolean predicate,
 *     and there is no "minimumShouldMatch" constraint (see below),
 *     then the "should" clauses are not required to match,
 *     and are simply used for scoring.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     When there is at least one "minimumShouldMatch" constraint (see below),
 *     then the "should" clauses are required according to the "minimumShouldMatch" constraints.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Matching "should" clauses are taken into account in score computation.
 *
 * <h3 id="minimumshouldmatch">"minimumShouldMatch" constraints</h3>
 * <p>
 * "minimumShouldMatch" constraints define a minimum number of "should" clauses that have to match
 * in order for the boolean predicate to match.
 * <p>
 * The feature is similar, and will work identically, to
 * <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/7_3_0/solr-core/org/apache/solr/util/doc-files/min-should-match.html">"Min Number Should Match"</a>
 * in Solr or
 * <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-minimum-should-match.html">{@code minimum_should_match}</a>
 * in Elasticsearch.
 *
 * <h4 id="minimumshouldmatch-minimum">Definition of the minimum</h4>
 * <p>
 * The minimum may be defined either directly as a positive number, or indirectly as a negative number
 * or positive or negative percentage representing a ratio of the total number of "should" clauses in this boolean predicate.
 * <p>
 * Here is how each type of input is interpreted:
 * <dl>
 *     <dt>Positive number</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         The value is interpreted directly as the minimum number of "should" clauses that have to match.
 *     </dd>
 *     <dt>Negative number</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         The absolute value is interpreted as the maximum number of "should" clauses that may not match:
 *         the absolute value is subtracted from the total number of "should" clauses.
 *     </dd>
 *     <dt>Positive percentage</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         The value is interpreted as the minimum percentage of the total number of "should" clauses that have to match:
 *         the percentage is applied to the total number of "should" clauses, then rounded down.
 *     </dd>
 *     <dt>Negative percentage</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         The absolute value is interpreted as the maximum percentage of the total number of "should" clauses that may not match:
 *         the absolute value of the percentage is applied to the total number of "should" clauses, then rounded down,
 *         then subtracted from the total number of "should" clauses.
 *     </dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * In any case, if the computed minimum is 0 or less, or higher than the total number of "should" clauses,
 * behavior is backend-specific (it may throw an exception, or produce unpredictable results,
 * or fall back to some default behavior).
 *
 * <h4 id="minimumshouldmatch-conditionalconstraints">Conditional constraints</h4>
 * <p>
 * Multiple conditional constraints may be defined,
 * only one of them being applied depending on the total number of "should" clauses.
 * <p>
 * Each constraint is attributed a minimum number of "should" clauses
 * that have to match, <strong>and an additional number</strong>.
 * The additional number is unique to each constraint.
 * <p>
 * The additional number will be compared to the total number of "should" clauses,
 * and the one closest while still strictly lower will be picked: its associated constraint will be applied.
 * If no number matches, the minimum number of matching "should" clauses
 * will be set to the total number of "should" clauses.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <pre><code>
 *     // Example 1: at least 3 "should" clauses have to match
 *     booleanContext1.minimumShouldMatchNumber( 3 );
 *     // Example 2: at most 2 "should" clauses may not match
 *     booleanContext2.minimumShouldMatchNumber( -2 );
 *     // Example 3: at least 75% of "should" clauses have to match (rounded down)
 *     booleanContext3.minimumShouldMatchPercent( 75 );
 *     // Example 4: at most 25% of "should" clauses may not match (rounded down)
 *     booleanContext4.minimumShouldMatchPercent( -25 );
 *     // Example 5: if there are 3 "should" clauses or less, all "should" clauses have to match.
 *     // If there are 4 "should" clauses or more, at least 90% of "should" clauses have to match (rounded down).
 *     booleanContext5.minimumShouldMatchPercent( 3, 90 );
 *     // Example 6: if there are 4 "should" clauses or less, all "should" clauses have to match.
 *     // If there are 5 to 9 "should" clauses, at most 25% of "should" clauses may not match (rounded down).
 *     // If there are 10 "should" clauses or more, at most 3 "should" clauses may not match.
 *     booleanContext6.minimumShouldMatchPercent( 4, 25 )
 *             .minimumShouldMatchNumber( 9, -3 );
 * </code></pre>
